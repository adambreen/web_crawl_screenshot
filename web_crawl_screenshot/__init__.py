"""
__init__.py for the web_crawl_screenshot package.

This file marks the 'web_crawl_screenshot' directory as a Python package,
allowing imports from modules like 'web_crawl_screenshot.main'. It also
serves as a logical place to put package-level docstrings, constants,
or other items that should be visible upon importing the package at
the top level.

Typically, this file can remain empty if you do not need any package-wide
initialization. However, including it (even empty) is a recommended best
practice for explicit packaging and to ensure tools like pytest, linters,
and third-party libraries recognize this folder as a Python package.
"""

# You can also define __all__ here if you want to control what gets imported
# with 'from web_crawl_screenshot import *'. For now, it's left empty or minimal.
__all__ = []
